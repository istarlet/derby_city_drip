# Derby City Drip
## Description

## CSS Feature
```
A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical 
and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
```
## Javascript Feature

## Additional CSS Feature
Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on a desktop.
