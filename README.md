# Derby City Drip
## Description
I chose the Code Louisville FEWD Coffee Shop mockup as my project. https://github.com/CodeLouisville/FEWD-CoffeeShop

## Media Queries
```
You must include a minimum of 2 media queries that create a better layout/user experience.

They must make some visible changes to your site’s layout, such as re-aligning/moving content 
areas, changing your menu, changing the location of content areas and images, hiding/showing 
elements, etc. 
```

## CSS Feature
```
A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching 
between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
```

## Javascript Feature
```
Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user 
interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code.
```

## Additional CSS Feature
```
Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic 
flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange 
content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a 
two-column layout on a desktop.
```
I used a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox.
